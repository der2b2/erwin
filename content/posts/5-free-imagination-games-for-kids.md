In times of Smartphones, TVs and constant and often times overwhelming amount of visual input, people tend to unlearn the ability to be able to use their creative potential without an external impulse. Even worse, some kids never really learn how to play only with their imagination.

Creativity is the process to solve a problem. Imagination boosts your creativity by producing images and sensations in the mind without direct external input like seeing or hearing. It helps making unusual combinations and form new ideas. Your imagination is fundamental for the learning process.

The following games don’t need tools or items. They can be played only with your imagination (and your body). Ideal for boring times on the road or at places where you don’t have enough space or tools. They represent a pure version of creative games, because your imagination doesn’t get any tools and has to do the fun work all alone.

Consider that these games can be the most exhausting, because the brain has to really work. Virtual pictures have to be painted and stories have to emerge out of nowhere. Make pauses at least every ten minutes.

Some games may seem simple, but it is the elementary nature of these games that can ignite a spark in your kids mindset, if you’re doing them constantly. So even a short game of 5 min every 2 to 3 days can have a lot of impact.

It may be possible that you have to help your kid to find into the game. That is normal as you are introducing them to unusual thinking, and they are not used to do this on purpose, especially not coming from an adult who is always trying to teach them „normal“ thinking. Be patient, eventually your kid will be thankful.

## Name Your Fingers
### How does it work:
In the first round, everyone has to find a name for his thumb. The name can be a real name, or a fantasy word. In addition to that, every player has to name a superpower for the thumb. When the player says: „My thumb is named Jack, and his superpower is super strength“, it’s the next player’s turn.

Once the first round is completed, the second round starts. The player has to repeat the name and power of the thumb and find a name and a superpower for the index finger. When everyone has completed round 2, the next round can start. And for each finger on one hand there will be an extra round. The player always has to speak out all previous and next finger’s names and superpowers.

For a light variant for this game just skip the superpower part and only find the names for each finger.

### What is it good for:
Focus on a once made virtual construct ( name and superpower ) and keep it in your mind, while keep on working with your creativity.

## Muenchhausen
### How does it work:
This is a free imagination game. Let’s start with the phrase: „I saw a snail, that ...“. In turns, every player has to complete this phrase with whatever his or her imagination could come up for the snail.

For example:
- „I saw a snail, that could fly to the moon.“
- „I saw a snail, that was purple.“
- „I saw a snail, that was as huge as a house.“
As a variant you can use tree, fruit, shark or whatever else you like instead of snail.

### What is it good for:
Free imagination, letting your mind wander no matter in which direction.

## Favorite Food pantomime
### How does it work:
Every player has to present his or her favorite food via pantomime. Use of the whole body is allowed, but no helping tools and no words or other verbal hints. Anyone who uses even the slightest verbal hint will be disqualified for this round. The other players have to guess the food.

When everyone has presented her food, start the next round with everyone’s favorite animal.

### What is it good for:
Think about a virtual idea, here your favorite food, in a different way and find a creative solution, to speak with your body.

## Roleplay
How does it work:
Ask each player successively:

„What would your favorite animal do in a candy shop?“

Ask them for several details to get a concrete answer. Things like „The elephant would eat all the candies.“ do not count.

For example use these questions to concretize their answers, if they fit:

- „Which candies does it like most?“
- „Which colors do those candies have?“
- „Is your animal standing, sitting or running around?“
- „Did it get a messy mouth after eating candies?“
- „Did it get stomach ache?“

### What is it good for:
Putting themselves in the position of someone else and creating a story out of that.

## What is a Quadrulu
### How does it work:
This is a fun game for your imagination. Ask the kids the following question: "What is a Quadrulu?" To prevent you from googling it: I made this one up. If someone has an idea, start from there. Ask them further questions to create a precise picture of what a quadrulu looks like and what it is about.

If no one has a starting idea, use the following questions to get the imagination rolling:

- "Is it a machine?"
- "Is it an animal?"
- "Is it living in the ocean?"
- "How big is it?"
- "Which color does it have?"
- "How fast is it?"
- "How does it sound?"
- "What does it need?"
- "What is its purpose?"
- "Where does it live?"

Feel free to imagine more questions to keep the imaginary stone rolling.

### What is it good for:
Focusing on building something out of your imagination
