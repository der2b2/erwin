## Other static site generators

Over the time i've worked with several other static site generators. Mostly with gatsby.

I think gatsby is great for complex sites, i liked working with it on several projects. But i always thought, that for a simple blog or corporate site, gatsby is way to complex.

I wanted a simple, lightweight generator where i could easily controll every aspect of my project. 

In gatsby, there is almost for every problem a solution in the packages u can install. But i often ran into compatibility problems between packages.

One day the build was fine, a week later i had errors building the app although i hadn't changed anything. So i spend a lot of time debugging package issues, where i just wanted to work on the actual site.

## What i was searching for

So i thought about my ideal site generator and made a list:

- minimal packages that are widely used, tested and not dependeing on each other
- a package manager 
- open source
- simple setup
- bootstrap css (gatsby is not built to be used with bootstrap)
- i love python, so a python generator would be ideal
- take away all the annoying stuff like thumbnail generation, sitemaps, responsive images etc
- fast
- Seo

I searched the web for a ready to use static site generator, but could not find one.

And then an idea emerged: Could i do this myself? Am i capable of developing a fully working site generator in python? Able to fullfill all my wishes for future web project for me and for customers?

My answer was: well, i dunno, but at least i'll try

## Birth of Erwin SSG

So i started. I learned a lot about technical web stuff. 

It wasn't my goal to write the most beautiful piece of code ever written, but to get this project done. To get a stable piece of software that i could use in producing real projects.

And here it is, i'm proud of it.
