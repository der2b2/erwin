While most private and public schools require some sort of physical education, homeschoolers regulations vary by state. But when we don’t include time for sports and physical activity in our homeschooled kids’ days, we’re depriving them of some wonderful benefits--mentally, physically, and socially!

Here are just a few reasons why you should remember to include sport sessions in your homeschool schedule.

## Stay In Shape
Did you know that childhood obesity affects nearly 20% of our nation’s kids?

What exactly is to blame for this staggering statistic? Junk food and lack of activity. These days, our kids are spending less time running and jumping and playing outside and more time sitting in front of a screen.

And obesity isn’t just a superficial problem. According to a [Harvard study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/health-effects/), obesity can lead to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, and more.

By setting aside time for your kids to get outside and move their body, you’re investing in their long term health.

## Active Kids are Happy Kids
As you know, homeschooling is more than just the sum of its parts. You don’t do things simply because they’re required--you do them because there is a holistic benefit. Physical education is part of this!

A review of studies from [Bridgewater State University](https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&context=undergrad_rev) found that homeschooled children participating in physical education sessions “derived enjoyment” from the activity. They were more excited to return to class and looked forward to future physical activity sessions.

With homeschooling, we want our kids to be happy, healthy, and well-rounded. Physical education is a critical part of that.

## Learn About Nature
Even if you prefer to give your homeschooled kids unstructured play time outside, they can still reap many benefits. Let them explore your backyard and local area. They will soak up a natural education about the plants, animals, and insects in your area.

If you have local bike or hiking trails, you can head to your local nature center for an education about preservation and your local habitat. When you get creative, there are plenty of ways for your kids to learn outside!

## Build Social Skills and Friendship
Physical activity for homeschooled kids doesn’t have to be a solo experience. Some states allow homeschoolers to join public school sports teams, and there are private teams you can join as well.

If you opt for a team sport or physical activity where your kids get to spend some time with other people, it can have excellent benefits for their social education!

[The Bridgewater State University](https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&context=undergrad_rev) review also found that homeschooled kids participating in group physical activity learned greater respect for others, which translated into their home lives. Plus, both the parents and children involved in the study found that they enjoyed the friendships made from such activity.

These are just a few of the many benefits to including sport sessions in your homeschooling plan. If you want to improve your children’s mental, physical, and social health, try working physical activity into your homeschool plan this week!
