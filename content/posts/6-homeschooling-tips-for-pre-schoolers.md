## Daily Schedule
Make a daily plan. Inlude rest periods and a pause to eat. Without a plan, homeschooling will eventually end in chaos because both kids and parents will find more and more excuses.

## Mix it Up
Include different learning ares and methods. Mix things like tracing paper for geometric forms and letters, free drawing, reading lectures, simple calculations and handicraft work

## Include Sport Sessions
Don't forget physical activity. There are very good sessions for pre schoolers on youtube. Sport ist a great in between distraction when concentration drops while learning

## Dedicated Learning Area
Build a distraction free learning space. This helps them to focus and to get in the right mood the instance they sit down.

## Stick To The Plan
It's ok to adapt the plan to daily circumstances and moods, but in general you should try to stick to your plan as long as it makes sense.

## Patience
Pre schoolers are ready to learn. Nature gave them a strong curiosity and the will to discover. You can drown their joy to research with too much pressure. So be patient!
