## Usage
There are three scripts that can be run:

### clean.py
Clean the output folder, basically erases the complete output folder to get rid of old files

    python clean.py


### build.py
This script builds the whole website and stores it ready for deploying into the output folder

    python build.py


### serve.py
Starts a simple local Webserver for testing. The webserver just serves the stored files from the build script.

    python serve.py

Server runs on "localhost:8000"
