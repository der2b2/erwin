There are four scripts that can be run:

## init
After install, initialize erwin site structure with:

    python erwin.py init


## clean
Clean the output folder, basically erases the complete output folder to get rid of old files

    python erwin.py clean


## build
This script builds the whole website and stores it ready for deploying into the output folder

    python erwin.py build


## serve
Starts a simple local Webserver for testing. The webserver just serves the stored files from the build script.

    python erwin.py serve

Server runs on "localhost:5050", port can be changed in site_config.ini
